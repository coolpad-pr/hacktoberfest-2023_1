Given string str of length N. The task is to find the minimum characters to be added at the front to make string palindrome.
Note: A palindrome is a word which reads the same backward as forward. Example: "madam".

Example 1:

Input:
S = "abc"
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Add 'b' and 'c' at front of above string to make it
palindrome : "cbabc"

def minCharsToMakePalindrome(s):
    def isPalindrome(s):
        return s == s[::-1]

    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        if isPalindrome(s[:i]):
            return n - i

# Example usage:
S = "abc"
result = minCharsToMakePalindrome(S)
print(result)  # Output: 2
